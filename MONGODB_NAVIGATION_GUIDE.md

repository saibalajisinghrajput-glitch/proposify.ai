## 🎯 HOW TO FIND YOUR CONNECTION STRING

I can't open the website for you, but here's exactly what to do when you visit https://cloud.mongodb.com:

---

## 🔐 STEP 1: LOGIN
1. **Go to**: https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. **Click**: "Log In"
3. **Enter**: Your email and password
4. **Click**: "Log In"

---

## 📊 STEP 2: FIND YOUR CLUSTER
1. **Look for**: "Clusters" in the left sidebar
2. **Click**: "Clusters"
3. **You'll see**: A list of your database clusters
4. **Find**: Your cluster (usually named "Cluster0" or similar)
5. **Look for**: A green "Available" status indicator

---

## 🔌 STEP 3: GET CONNECTION STRING
1. **Find**: Your cluster in the list
2. **Click**: The "Connect" button (blue button on the right)
3. **A popup will appear** with connection options
4. **Click**: "Connect your application"
5. **You'll see**: A connection string that looks like this:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

---

## ✏️ STEP 4: CUSTOMIZE THE STRING
1. **Copy**: The connection string from the popup
2. **Replace**: `<username>` with your database username (usually "proposifyuser")
3. **Replace**: `<password>` with your database password (the one you created when setting up the database)

**Final result should look like**:
```
mongodb+srv://proposifyuser:YourPassword123@cluster0.abcd.mongodb.net/proposify?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

---

## 🔍 ALTERNATIVE: IF YOU DON'T SEE A CLUSTER

### If you don't see any clusters:
1. **Click**: "Create a new cluster" (or "Build a Database")
2. **Choose**: "M0 Free" (free tier)
3. **Select**: A region close to you
4. **Click**: "Create cluster"
5. **Wait**: 2-3 minutes for it to be ready
6. **Follow steps 2-4 above** to get connection string

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU'LL SEE

**Connection String Format**:
```
mongodb+srv://proposifyuser:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/proposify?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**This is your MONGODB_URI value!**

## 📝 QUICK CHECKLIST

**Before you copy the string, verify**:
- [ ] You can see your cluster in the Clusters list
- [ ] The cluster status shows "Available" (green)
- [ ] The connection string contains your username and password
- [ ] It starts with `mongodb+srv://`

**Ready to copy when**:
- [ ] You have the complete connection string
- [ ] You've replaced the placeholder username and password
- [ ] The string ends with `?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

---

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES

**Can't find Clusters section**:
- Make sure you're logged in
- Look for "Clusters" in the left navigation menu

**Cluster shows "Creating"**:
- Wait 2-3 minutes for it to become "Available"
- Try refreshing the page

**Connection string has placeholders**:
- Replace `<username>` with your actual database username
- Replace `<password>` with your actual database password
- These were created when you first set up the database

**Don't have a database user**:
1. Go to "Database Access" in left sidebar
2. Click "Add New Database User"
3. Create username: `proposifyuser`
4. Create a secure password
5. Set privileges to "Atlas admin"
6. Click "Add User"

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Save the string**: Copy it to a text file immediately
**Keep it safe**: This contains your database credentials
**Test it**: Make sure the password works when you replace the placeholder

**Once you have this connection string, that's your first value! Then we can get the OpenAI API key, generate JWT secret, and get Stripe key (optional).**
