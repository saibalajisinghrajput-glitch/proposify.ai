# 🚀 Deployment Complete!

Your React application is now **live** on the web.

## 🌐 Live URL
**[https://saibalajisinghrajput-glitch.github.io/proposify.ai](https://saibalajisinghrajput-glitch.github.io/proposify.ai)**

*(Note: It may take 1-2 minutes for GitHub to update the site. If you see a 404, just refresh in a moment.)*

## ⚠️ Important Note About Features
You requested to "deploy in react", so I have deployed the **Frontend** (the visual part of the website). 

However, the **Backend** (the AI that generates the resumes and contracts) is **not yet connected** to this live site because it requires a server like Render or Railway.

### What works?
- ✅ The Website UI loads perfectly.
- ✅ You can navigate between pages.
- ✅ You can see the design and layout.

### What doesn't work yet?
- ❌ Logging in (requires database).
- ❌ Generating AI documents (requires backend server).

## 🔧 How to fix the Backend (Optional)
If you want the AI features to work on this live URL, you need to deploy the backend.
Since I cannot do this without your passwords, you can do it easily:
1. **[Click here to Deploy Backend to Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/saibalajisinghrajput-glitch/proposify.ai)**
2. Once deployed, get the URL (e.g., `https://proposify-backend.onrender.com`).
3. Tell me that URL, and I will update your React app to talk to it.
